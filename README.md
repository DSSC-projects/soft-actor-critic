# Soft Actor-Critic

The repository contains the final project from the course in Reinforcement Learning delivered by the Data Science and Scientific Computing master course at the University of Trieste, SISSA, ICTP and University of Udine. In this project, we implement the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, and test it on continuous control tasks from the Mujoco robotic simulator.
